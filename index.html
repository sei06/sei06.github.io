<p> Hi, I'm Youssif! I'm a sophomore my undergraduate studies at Stanford University majoring in computer science and math.</p>
<p> In the past, I've been interested in hardware and electronics. In the past, I worked at the MIT Media Lab as part of the Fluid Interfaces Group (led by Prof Pattie Maes), 
  working on <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/attentivu/overview/">AttentivU</a>, a device, in the form factor of a pair of glasses that senses brain activity (through EEGs)
  and eye movements to measure and respond to different cognitive processes in real time.
  During my time in the Media Lab I built 2 new version of AttentivU with new magnetic hinges that reduced the device’s failure rate during field testing as well as
  presented the lab’s work at MIT Augmenting Brains Conference in the MIT Museum. </p>
